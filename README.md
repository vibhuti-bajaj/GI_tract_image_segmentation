The UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation project aims to automate the segmentation of stomach and intestines in MRI scans for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the project seeks to enhance treatment planning processes for radiation oncologists, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The dataset consists of MRI scans from actual cancer patients, accompanied by masks for organ segmentation. Preprocessing and augmentation techniques were employed to prepare the data for model training. Experimentation with various deep learning architectures and iterative refinement led to the development of a model capable of accurately segmenting the GI tract.
